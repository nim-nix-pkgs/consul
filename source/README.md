# nim_consul
Consul Agent access for Nim.

This library provides an SDK around the Consul (https://www.consul.io/) HTTP API. Currently it's extremely underdeveloped; it exposes a single element of the api, kvGet, which allows for the retrieval of elements from the Consul kv store.

See the [docs](https://makingspace.github.io/nim_consul/) for more info.
